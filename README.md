A URL shortener is a tool that converts long web addresses (URLs) into shorter, more manageable links.

In this we design a URL shortener service that takes in a valid URL and returns a shortened URL, redirecting the user to the previously provided URL. Also keep track of total visit on the URL.

Routes POST/URL- Generates a new short URL and returns the shortened URL. GET /:id-Redirects the user to the original URL
